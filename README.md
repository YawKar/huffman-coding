# Huffman Coding - my implementation of the well-known huffman coding
A very small command-line program that encodes and decodes files via Huffman coding algorithm

## How to use
1. Build with the means of CMake
2. Run
3. Enter `encode`
4. Enter the name of the file that should be encoded
5. Enter the name of the output encoded file
6. *Wait...*
7. Profit! Now you have encoded version of your file and to decode it back let's go to the next step
8. Run program again
9. Enter `decode`
10. Enter the name of the encoded file
11. Enter the name of the output decoded file
12. *Wait...*
13. Profit! You (probably) successfully encoded and decoded your file!
